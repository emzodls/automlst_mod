Automatic Multi-Locus Species Tree (autoMLST) Overview
====================================================
autoMLST is a webserver and analysis pipeline for constructing species phylogenies from genomic data. The pipeline scans for conserved single copy housekeeping genes, selects comparible genomes in the database, and builds a phylogeny using either a concatenated gene matrix or coalescent tree method.
